# AI-TicTacToe-MinMax

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game (also known as **Triqui** in some regions), using the **MIN-MAX** algorithm to develop an AI that plays against a human player. The project is part of a workshop from **Pontificia Universidad Javeriana**, exploring fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence applied to strategy games.

## Repository Contents

- **Source Code**: Implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game with the MIN-MAX algorithm in Python.
- **Documentation**: Detailed instructions and analysis on state representation, heuristic function, successor generation, and the application of the MIN-MAX algorithm.
- **Examples**: Examples of games played by the AI and performance analysis of the algorithm.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/AI-TicTacToe-MinMax.git
   cd AI-TicTacToe-MinMax
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
   - No external libraries are required; the code runs with standard Python.

3. **Run the Game**:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

   The game will start in the terminal, allowing you to play against the MIN-MAX based AI.

## Code Structure

- `tic_tac_toe.py`: Main file containing the game logic and the implementation of the MIN-MAX algorithm.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- `examples/`: Folder containing example games and analysis of the results.

## Credits

- **Nuhagh**: Special thanks to GitHub user [Nuhagh](https://github.com/Nuhagh) for providing the base code for the Tic-Tac-Toe game, which has been modified and extended to include the MIN-MAX algorithm implementation in this workshop.
